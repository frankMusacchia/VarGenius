##Mission
*VarGenius* is a pipeline for the detection and annotation of genetic variants. It can be currently used with WES and targeted sequencing.

##Installation and tutorial

To start using *VarGenius* you must follow instructions in the **GUIDE** folder.
Below is a simple introduction of what you will find there and how to find solutions to possible problems.
- *VarGenius* has some specific purposes. To figure out what they are, please read the [INTRO](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius/blob/master/GUIDE/INTRO.md) file;
- Since *VarGenius* is a pipeline, it uses some software that you have to download and install. Please follow 
the instructions on how to do it in the [INSTALL](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius/blob/master/GUIDE/INSTALL.md) file. There you will also learn how to install *VarGenius*;
- After you install you can try to run the pipeline for the first time. Few settings are needed before to run. Please follow instructions from the [TUTORIAL](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius/blob/master/GUIDE/TUTORIAL.md).
- The tutorial will guide you to obtain the first output of *VarGenius*. Clearly, you will need some help to understand how is it formed. Please read carefully the [OUTPUT](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius/blob/master/GUIDE/OUTPUT.md) page for this.
- Once you ran several times *VarGenius* you will become expert and start to wonder how to do other things. Please read the [ADVANCED_USAGE](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius/blob/master/GUIDE/ADVANCED_USAGE.md) page to get useful hints.
- If you experience some problem using *VarGenius* please refer to Frequently


Please enjoy this product and send us questions and suggestions!

##System Requirements

To work, *VarGenius* needs:
- PostgreSQL database
- Perl
- BioPerl
- R 
- samtools
- picard
- GATK
- BWA
- TrimGalore
- FastQC
- bedtools
- Annovar

Check for the tested versions in the [INSTALL](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius/blob/master/GUIDE/INSTALL.md) page.


##*VarGenius* times and space

*VarGenius* can be  used only with a PBS cluster. It has been desigend to create jobs with the **qsub** command. The execution time depends strongly from the speed and memory of your machine. 

The pipeline needs around 5 hours to run the complete sequence of tasks. Depending by the queue and resources used by other users of the cluster, jobs will wait less or more time.


###Database Creation

*VarGenius* creates a PosgreSQL database the first time you run it. Three sets of tables are present: 1. those regarding the management of the analyses; 2. the tables with variants information and 3. the tables with the gene's information. 
While the first two are filled during your analyses, the latter is constructed the first time you run *VarGenius* and it allows to get a link between the variant detected and the genes. Genes information are downloaded from multiple sources (RefSeq, HPO, GDI, RVIS) and stored into tables using the command -genedb. You can keep this tables up to date by running again the database generation task.


####Space

The space needed to build the PosgreSQL database depends from the number of variants contained.  100 samples (WES and targeted) consisting of 300 thousands variants use around 4GB of disk space. 

The space needed for all the default databases of Annovar takes 1.2 Terabyte in our system
